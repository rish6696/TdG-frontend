Frontend Interview Test

Introduction
If you are here it means you would like to join our team as a Frontend developer, this is great!
Before you will join our community there is a short test we need you to do, a simple PSD to HTML task. Please read in detail this document.

What to do next

Clone this repository to your local pc
Create a new branch to work on (feel free to name it as you'd like)
Open the "frontend-test.png" file to see what is expected from you to deliver, this file includes behavior guidelines that you will need to implement


Create a new project in the branch which will include complete structure as below
- root
    - index.html
    - css
    - js
    - img
    - fonts
    
Please include ALL source files including and  push everything to the remote.
Once done - please create a merge request from your branch to master, and send an email to your PM (who sent you this repo :) ) so we'll know to check the delivery.


Transitions
The test doesn't describe the transitions and animations, please do make sure to add animations to make the transitions smoother.

What we look for in your delivery

We are looking for pixel perfect delivery, make sure to match everything exactly as it is in the design, so when using a pixel-perfect comparison, it will match 100%.
Keep in mind we develop a dynamic website, make sure to consider the option of repeatable items, different image sizes, and different text, the page should look great regardless of the content in it.
We expect the code to be minimal, very organized and linted. We won't accept "Spaghetti" code even if the frontend looks perfect. Keep in mind that your code when working with us will be sliced to sections and integrated into WordPress, make the backend developer life easier.
It goes without saying the delivery should be responsive to support all device resolutions


What we will test in your delivery

Check pixel-perfect layout according to the provided design.
Apply various ratios and layouts to test responsiveness of assets.
